\section{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:problemDefinition}

Three tasks to do in this section: 1) define the small components in this paper; 2) formally define the problem with your components; 3) prove the hardness of the proposed problem through a theorem.

\begin{theorem} (Hardness of the XX Problem)
	The problem of the Example Problem (XX) is
	NP-hard. \label{theo:np}
\end{theorem}

To learn how to prove NP-hardness, read the example \cite{cheng2017utility}.

Usually, at the end of this section, add a table to list the important variables used in this paper as a reference.

\begin{table}

		\caption{\small Symbols and Descriptions.} \label{table0}
		\begin{tabular}{l|l}
			{\bf Symbol} & {\bf \qquad \qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad Description} \\ \hline \hline
			$R$   & a set of $m$ time-constrained riders\\
			$r_i$   & a rider $r_i$ sending ride request $q_i$\\
			$s_i$  & the source location of ride request $q_i$\\
			$e_i$   & the destination location of ride request $q_i$\\
			\hline
